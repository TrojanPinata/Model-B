# Model-B
75% keyboard based on the RP2040 MCU with hotswappable switches, OLED display, and rotary encoder.

The Model-B is the second keyboard I've developed and aims to be the direct successor to the [Model-K](https://github.com/TrojanPinata/Model-K-Pico). I made this with the intention to develop a hotswappable keyboard which uses SMD components in order to reduce soldering overhead and learn microcontroller hardware development. The case is clear acrylic with a delrin switchplate and holds a eleven degree angle, and is reasonably heavy - a much more complete feel compared to the Model-K. 

See [what_is_this.md](what_is_this.md) for some info regarding why I made this and some of the specifics for getting setup.
