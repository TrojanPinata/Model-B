# Model-B
75% keyboard based on the RP2040 MCU with hotswappable switches, OLED display, and rotary encoder.

The Model-B is the second keyboard I've developed and aims to be the direct successor to the [Model-K](https://github.com/TrojanPinata/Model-K-Pico). I made this with the intention to develop a hotswappable keyboard which uses SMD components in order to reduce soldering overhead and learn microcontroller hardware development. The case was chosen to be made of acrylic as it was the cheapest option for the level of quality I wanted to achieve. My goal was to make a keyboard which could be sent to my friends while maintaining the same general style the Model-K had.
